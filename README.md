Code Bundler CLI
This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for bundling code files from a specified list of programming languages into a single file. The bundled file can optionally include comments for the file origin, remove empty lines, and be sorted by name or type.

Features
Bundle Command: Allows bundling of code files into one file.
Create Response File Command: Simplifies the usage of the bundle command by generating a response file containing all necessary options.
Installation
Clone the repository or download the source files.
Compile the project using your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).
Build the project into an executable.
Usage
bundle Command
This command bundles source code files from the current directory into a single file.

Options:
--language (-l)
A list of programming languages to include in the bundle (comma-separated).
Valid options: csharp, python, javascript, java, html, css, jsx, angular, or all (for all supported languages).
Required.

--output (-o)
The output file path and name for the bundle.
If not provided, the file will be created in the current directory.
Optional.

--note (-n)
Whether to include the file origin as comments in the bundle.
Optional.

--sort (-s)
The sorting order for files: either by name (default) or by type.
Optional.

--remove-empty-lines (-r)
Whether to remove empty lines from the source files before bundling.
Optional.

Example:
bundle --output "bundle.txt" --language "python,java" --sort "name" --remove-empty-lines --note
create-rsp Command
This command helps users easily generate a response file that can be used with the bundle command. The user will be prompted to input the required options, and the command will create a .rsp file.

Example:
create-rsp
Once the user fills in the necessary details, a .rsp file is created. To execute the bundled command later, use the following:

dotnet @responseFile.rsp
Example Workflow:
Generate a Response File: Run the create-rsp command and answer the prompts.
Run the bundle Command: Execute the generated .rsp file to bundle the files based on the provided options.
How It Works
Language Option:
The --language option specifies which programming languages should be bundled. If "all" is selected, all code files in the directory will be included.

Output Option:
The --output option specifies the file path and name for the output bundle. If left empty, the file is created in the current directory.

Note Option:
When the --note option is selected, each fileâ€™s origin (path) is included as a comment in the bundle, making it easier to trace back the source files.

Sorting Option:
Files can be sorted by name (default) or by type (file extension). Sorting helps maintain better organization within the bundled file.

Remove Empty Lines Option:
The --remove-empty-lines option removes empty lines from the source files before adding them to the bundle.

Creating a Response File:
The create-rsp command allows users to answer prompts for all the bundle options, which are then saved into a .rsp file for easy future use.

Notes:
File Paths: If the output file path contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double quotes.
Directory Restrictions: Files from directories like bin and debug are automatically excluded from the bundle.
Example of Running the Commands
Bundle Files:

bundle --output "C:\Bundles\my_bundle.txt" --language "python,java" --sort "name" --note --remove-empty-lines
Generate a Response File:

create-rsp
After providing the necessary input, the response file will be created.

Run the Response File:

dotnet @my_bundle_rsp.rsp
